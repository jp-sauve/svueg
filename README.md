# SVueG
My experiments with Vectors and Vue. Not sure where it's going, but I've created a slider pack component and an ellipse component. The slider is currently embedded in the ellipse, but I'd like to separate the two. maybe attach a slider to a shape for configuration, then detatch for display?
